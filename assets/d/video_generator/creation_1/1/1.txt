The sun, a lazy, golden eye, peered through the emerald canopy, bathing the rainforest floor in dappled light. It was a perfect day for Sid, a sloth with a perpetually bewildered expression and a penchant for chewing on leaves. He hung upside down, his long, spindly limbs clinging to a gnarled branch, his thick, shaggy fur shimmering in the sunlight.   "What a beautiful day," Sid sighed, a contented smile spreading across his face. He idly munched on a leaf, its bitter taste a familiar comfort. He wasn't much for excitement, preferred the slow, languid pace of life, a stark contrast to his younger brother, Sam.
